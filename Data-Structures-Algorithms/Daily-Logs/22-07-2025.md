# ðŸ“… Day 3 - 22/07/2025

## ðŸ“˜ Topic:
Object-Oriented Programming & Platform Dependency in Java

## âœ… Tasks:
- Studied: 
  - PDF notes on Platform Dependency and Object-Orientation
  - Markdown lecture notes covering:
    - Object File vs Executable File
    - Compiler vs Interpreter
    - Platform Dependent vs Independent Languages
    - OOP Basics: Class, Object, Real-World Analogies

## ðŸ§  Notes:
- Java is **platform-independent** because of the JVM.
- **Object Files** are intermediate files; **Executable Files** are ready to run.
- Compiler translates the entire code before execution; Interpreter translates line-by-line.
- OOP revolves around **classes** and **objects** â€” abstraction of real-world entities.
- Real-world analogies like *Car as a Class* and *Your Car as an Object* help visualize OOP principles.

## ðŸ”œ Next:
- Start from Naming Conventions, I/O & and Main() Method
