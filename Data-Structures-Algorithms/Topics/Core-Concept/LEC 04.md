# 📦 Lecture 04: Memory Devices in a Computer

---

## 📝 Overview

Memory devices in a computer are essential for:
- Retaining data for execution
- Storing variables and programs
- Handling large capacities
- Supporting input/output operations

---

## 🧠 Types of Memory

1. **Primary Memory**  
   _Also known as RAM/Main Memory_
2. **Secondary Memory**  
   _Also known as Hard Disk/HDD_

---

### 📌 Key Definitions

- **Bit:** Smallest location on RAM where data is stored (0 or 1)
- **Byte:** A storage location on RAM (8 bits)
- **Register:** Storage location on the processor (CPU) for data

---

## 🔄 Loading and Saving

- **Loading:**  
  Copying data from the hard disk to RAM for processing (execution/applications)
- **Saving:**  
  Copying data from RAM to the hard disk for permanent storage

> **Note:**  
> 1 RAM is a collection of bytes.

# 🧮 RAM Architecture (Random Access Memory)

### 📌 Diagram Explanation

- **Address/Expression Bus**
- **RAM Block** (example shown)
- **Registers** (in CPU)
- **Data Flow:** Storage → RAM → Register  
  _(Arrows show data movement and address buses)_

## 🧮 Memory Units

| Unit           | Value                          |
|----------------|-------------------------------|
| **1 Bit**      | 0 or 1                        |
| **1 Byte**     | 8 Bits                        |
| **1 KB**       | 1024 Bytes (2¹⁰)              |
| **1 MB**       | 1024 KB (2²⁰)                 |
| **1 GB**       | 1024 MB (2³⁰)                 |
| **1 TB**       | 1024 GB (2⁴⁰)                 |
| **1 PB**       | 1024 TB (2⁵⁰)                 |
| **1 EB**       | 1024 PB (2⁶⁰)                 |
| **1 ZB**       | 1024 EB (2⁷⁰)                 |
| **1 YB**       | 1024 ZB (2⁸⁰)                 |

> **Note:**  
> 1 Giga Byte is the highest memory measurement unit
