Object-Orientation refers to the **perspective of looking at the real world as a "Collection of Objects"**.

## 📜 Principles of Object-Orientation

1. **The world is a collection of Objects.**
2. **Every Object is useful.**  
   ➤ No object is 100% useless.
3. **Every Object needs to interact with others**  
   ➤ Objects cooperate to perform tasks.
4. **Every Object belongs to a type.**  
   ➤ This type is known as a **Class**.
5. **Every Object has 2 parts:**  
   - **Has-Part** (Data / Facts)  
   - **Does-Part** (Behavior / Methods)

## 🧍‍♂️ Objects in Real Life – Example: `Student`

| Part                  | Description                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **State / Properties**| Has-Part (e.g., Name, ID, Age)              |
| **Behavior / Activity**| Does-Part (e.g., Attend Class, Submit Assignment) |

- **Facts** → Attributes / Data  
- **Methods** → Activities
